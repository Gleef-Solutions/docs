## Translation Table

### Basic Operations

### Translations from the Gleef CLI and Figma plugin
- When you create translations using the CLI or Figma plugin, they will appear as drafts in the Studio

## Working with Translation Keys

Translation keys serve as unique identifiers:
- **Create new keys** directly in the table
- **Edit key names** by clicking the key column
- **Search by key patterns** to find related translations
