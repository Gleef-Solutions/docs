# Review System

The review system organizes translation changes into changesets for quality control and collaborative approval before publication.

## How Review Works

### Changesets
Changes are grouped into **changesets** - collections of related translation modifications:
- **Created automatically** when you edit translations
- **Include creator information** and timestamps
- **Track all changes** with before/after comparisons
- **Enable batch review** of related modifications

### Review Process
1. **Changes appear** in the review queue as expandable cards
2. **Expand changesets** to see detailed modifications
3. **Review individual translations** within each changeset
4. **Approve or reject** specific changes
5. **Approved changes** are published automatically

### Changeset Cards
- **Expandable cards** show grouped changes
- **Creator attribution** identifies who made changes
- **Change counts** indicate scope of modifications
- **Language filtering** focuses review on specific locales

### Individual Change Review
- **Side-by-side comparison** shows original vs modified text
- **Multi-language view** displays all language variants
- **Figma integration** provides visual design context
- **Approve/reject buttons** for each translation

## Review Actions

### Approving Changes
- **Individual approval** - approve specific translations
- **Batch approval** - approve entire changesets
- **Partial approval** - approve some changes, reject others
- **Approved translations** go live immediately

### Rejecting Changes
- **Provide feedback** explaining rejection reasons
- **Rejected changes** return to draft status
- **Contributors are notified** of rejection and feedback
- **Changes can be revised** and resubmitted

## Collaboration

### Multi-Reviewer Workflow
- **Assign reviewers** based on language expertise
- **Multiple reviewers** can work on different changesets
- **Review comments** facilitate discussion
- **Review history** tracks all decisions

### Team Coordination
- **Dashboard notifications** alert reviewers to pending changes
- **Creator visibility** helps coordinate with translators
- **Status tracking** shows review progress
- **Review assignments** distribute workload across team

## Best Practices

### Effective Review
- **Review related changes together** within changesets
- **Consider visual context** using Figma integration
- **Check consistency** across similar translations
- **Provide constructive feedback** for rejected changes

### Review Workflow
- **Regular review sessions** prevent backlogs
- **Language-specific review** by native speakers
- **Quick approval** for minor corrections
- **Detailed review** for new features or major changes
