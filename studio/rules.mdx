## Creating Rules

### Rule Setup
1. **Navigate to Translation Rules** section

### Rule Types

**Tone and Voice**

- Define brand personality in translations
- Specify addressing conventions (tu/vous, Sie/du)

**Formatting Guidelines**
- Number formats (1,000 vs 1.000)
- Date formats (DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY)
- Currency display (€100 vs 100€)
- Time formats (24-hour vs 12-hour)

**Language Structure**
- Prefer present tense and active voice
- Avoid complex sentence structures
- Use consistent terminology across translations

## Rule Examples

```
