This section will guide you through the process of integrating Gleef into your website and starting your first A/B testing experiment on wording.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open the function.php file from the WordPress dashboard">
        In your WordPress dashboard, select the <b>Appearance</b> menu, then <b>Theme Editor</b>.
        You might need to select your theme in the upper right dropdown.

        Then, select the file `Theme Functions (functions.php)` in the right panel.

        You should see some code in the main window.

        <img
            className="screenshot"
            src="/images/integrations/screenshot_wordpress.png"
            alt="Wordpress integration instructions screenshot"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Copy/paste the integration code"}>
        Copy/paste this code within the window in the center.
        The following code will allow your website to display and track Gleef experiments.

        function gleef_script() {
        echo '<script src="https://script.cdn.api.gleef.eu/script.js"></script>
    }
        add_action("wp_head", "gleef_script", 0);
        ```
        Once you're done, click on the <b>Update File</b> button.
