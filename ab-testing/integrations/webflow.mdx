This section will guide you through the process of integrating Gleef into your website and starting your first A/B testing experiment on wording.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open your Webflow dashboard">
        Once in your [Webflow dashboard](https://webflow.com/dashboard), click the <b>'...'</b> on the website you would like to integrate Gleef, and then select the <b>Settings</b>.

        <img
            className="screenshot"
            src="/images/integrations/screenshot_webflow-1.avif"
            alt="Webflow integration instructions screenshot"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Copy/paste the integration code">
        You might go to the 'Custom code' tab then, in order to copy-paste our code within the window in the center.

            src="/images/integrations/screenshot_webflow-2.avif"
