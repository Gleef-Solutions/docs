This section will guide you through the process of integrating Gleef into your Framer store and starting your first A/B testing experiment on wording.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access your Framer website">
        Go to the '<b>Settings</b>' of your website, then '<b>General</b>'.
        
        Scroll down to the section '<b>Start of head tag</b>', in the '<b>Custom Code</b>' section.

        <img
            className="screenshot Framer"
            src="../images/integrations/screenshot_framer.avif"
            alt="Framer editor screenshot"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Gleef script">
        Copy paste the following line of code, making sure it's the first one in this section:

        ```liquid
        <script src="https://script.cdn.api.gleef.eu/script.js"></script>
        ```

        This code will allow your Framer store to display and track Gleef experiments.
        Once you've added the code, click on the <b>Save</b> button in the upper right corner.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Launch & manage experiments">
