This section will guide you through the process of integrating Gleef into your Shopify store and starting your first A/B testing experiment on wording.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access your Shopify theme code">
        Log in to your Shopify admin panel and navigate to <b>Online Store</b> -> <b>Themes</b>.
        Find your current theme and click <b>Actions</b> -> <b>Edit code</b>.

        You should see a list of template files in the left sidebar.

        <img
            className="screenshot Shopify"
            src="../images/integrations/screenshot_shopify.jpg"
            alt="Shopify theme editor screenshot"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Add the Gleef script to your theme"}>
        In the left sidebar, locate and click on the `theme.liquid` file under the Layout section.

        Find the closing `</head>` tag in the file. Before this tag, and before other scripts, paste the following code:

        ```liquid
        <script src="https://script.cdn.api.gleef.eu/script.js"></script>
        ```

        This code will allow your Shopify store to display and track Gleef experiments.
        Once you've added the code, click on the <b>Save</b> button in the upper right corner.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Launch & manage experiments">
        You're all set! Log into the Chrome Extension, and start creating and managing experiments on your Shopify website.
    </Step>
