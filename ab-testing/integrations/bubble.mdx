This section will guide you through the process of integrating Gleef into your Bubble store and starting your first A/B testing experiment on wording.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access your Bubble website">
        Open the app you're planning to integrate Gleef on, through your Bubble dashboard. 

        Once the app is opened, go to '<b>Settings</b>', then '<b>SEO/metatags</b>', scroll down up to the section '<b>Script/meta tags in header</b>'.

        <img
            className="screenshot Bubble"
            src="../images/integrations/screenshot_bubble.avif"
            alt="Bubble editor screenshot"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Gleef script">
        On top of the container, before anyother line of code, copy paste the followying code:

        ```liquid
        <script src="https://script.cdn.api.gleef.eu/script.js"></script>
        ```

        This code will allow your Bubble store to display and track Gleef experiments.
        Once you've added the code, click on the <b>Save</b> button in the upper right corner.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Launch & manage experiments">
        You're all set! Log into the Chrome Extension, and start creating and managing experiments on your Bubble app.
