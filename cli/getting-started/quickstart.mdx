description: 'Get up and running with Gleef CLI in minutes'
---

This guide will walk you through setting up your first translation project with Gleef CLI in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- [Installed Gleef CLI](/cli/getting-started/installation)
- [Authenticated with your API key](/cli/getting-started/installation#authenticate-with-gleef)
- A project with existing localization files (JSON, XML, YAML, or .strings)

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Navigate to your project">
    Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Gleef">
    Run the initialization command to set up Gleef in your project:
    
    ```bash
    gleef init
    ```
    
    This command will:
    - Prompt you to enter your locale file pattern using `{locale}` placeholder
    - Validate the pattern by loading your existing files
    - Map file/folder names to company locales if needed
    - Create a `.gleef/config.json` configuration file
    
    ### Common Patterns by Technology
    
    Here are typical patterns you might enter based on your stack:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    
    ```bash React/Next.js
    public/locales/{locale}.json
    # or for namespaced:
    src/locales/{locale}/{feature}.json
    ```
    
    ```bash Vue/Nuxt.js
    locales/{locale}.json
    # or for namespaced:
    lang/{locale}/{feature}.json
    ```
    
    ```bash Angular
    src/assets/i18n/{locale}.json
    # or for feature-based:
    src/app/{feature}/i18n/{locale}.json
    ```
    
    ```bash iOS (Swift)
    ios/MyApp/{locale}/{feature}.strings
    ```
    
    ```bash Android
    android/app/src/main/res/{locale}/strings.xml
    ```
    
    ```bash Rails
    config/locales/{locale}.yml
    # or for namespaced:
    config/locales/{locale}/{feature}.yml
    ```
    
    ```bash Laravel
    lang/{locale}.json
    # or for PHP arrays:
    resources/lang/{locale}/{feature}.php
    ```
    
    </CodeGroup>
    
    <Info>Always use the `{locale}` placeholder in your pattern - it's required for proper locale detection.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the setup">
    After entering your pattern and mapping any locales, you'll see output like:
    
    ```bash
    ✔ One pattern added successfully. You can add more in your config file.
    src/locales/{locale}.json
    Run `gleef translate` to start translating
    To customize nested/flat output per format, edit the formatOptions in .gleef/config.json
    ```
    
    Check the generated `.gleef/config.json` file to verify the configuration matches your project structure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push your first translations">
    Upload your existing translation keys to Gleef for AI translation:
    
    ```bash
    gleef push --skip-review
    ```
    
    This will:
    - Analyze your local translation files
    - Send new keys to Gleef for AI translation
    - Publish all translations without asking your team for review (similar to an initial commit)
    
    You'll see progress output like:
    ```
    Processing 15 new translations
    ✔ Your files were translated successfully. Your team can review them from Gleef Studio.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull translated content">
    After translations are reviewed and approved in Gleef Studio, sync them back:
    
    ```bash
    gleef pull
    ```
    
    This updates your local files with the latest approved translations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Project Structure

Here's an example of how Gleef CLI works with a typical project structure:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   └── locales/
│       ├── en-US.json
│       ├── fr-FR.json
│       └── es-ES.json
├── .gleef/
│   └── config.json
└── .gitignore
```

**Before initialization:** Only the locale files exist

**After `gleef init`:** Configuration is created

**After `gleef translate`:** Keys are sent to Gleef for translation

**After `gleef pull`:** Local files are updated with new translations

## Configuration File Example

After running `gleef init`, you'll have a `.gleef/config.json` file like this:

```json
{
  "localeFilePatterns": [
    "src/locales/{locale}.json"
  ],
  "formatOptions": {
    "json": {
      "nested": true
    }
  },
  "customLocaleNames": {
    "en-US": "english",
    "fr-FR": "french"
  }
}
```

The configuration includes:
- **localeFilePatterns**: Your pattern with `{locale}` placeholder
- **formatOptions**: Auto-detected based on your file types
- **customLocaleNames**: Only added if your files don't match standard locale names

## Common Workflows
<Info>All commands can be added to your CI/CD or build scripts to automate updating or creating translations.</Info>

### Adding New Translation Keys

1. Add new keys to your base language file (e.g., `en-US.json`)
2. Run `gleef translate` to send them for translation
3. Review translations in Gleef Studio
4. Run `gleef pull` to sync approved translations

### Updating Existing Translations

1. Modify existing keys in your local files
2. Run `gleef translate` to update the translations
3. Review changes in Gleef Studio
4. Run `gleef pull --all` to sync all updates

### Working with Multiple Developers

1. Each developer runs `gleef pull` before starting work
2. Make translation changes locally
3. Run `gleef translate` to push changes
4. Coordinate reviews in Gleef Studio
5. Run `gleef pull` to get the latest approved translations
