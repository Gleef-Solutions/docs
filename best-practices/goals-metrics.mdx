---

Clear goals and well-defined metrics are essential to the success of any A/B test. Without a clear understanding of what you’re testing and how you’ll measure success, the results of your experiment will be hard to interpret.

## Defining Goals

### What is the Objective of Your A/B Test?
Your objective should align with your business priorities. The most common objectives for A/B testing include:
- **Increasing Conversion Rates:** Encourage more visitors to take specific actions, like signing up or making a purchase.
- **Reducing Bounce Rates:** Keep users engaged on the site for longer.
- **Improving User Engagement:** Increase interactions with key elements like videos, forms, or CTAs.

### Broader Objectives
While A/B testing is commonly used to drive revenue, it can also help with:
- Reducing opt-out rates
- Increasing upsells
- Improving after-sales service engagement

<Tip>
    A/B testing isn't just for revenue growth—it can help reduce costs, too. <br/>

## Measuring Success

### How Will You Measure Success?
The success of your A/B test depends on defining the right **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** that reflect your test objectives:
- **Conversion Rate (CR):** The percentage of users completing the desired action.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** The ratio of users who clicked on a specific link or CTA.
- **Bounce Rate:** The percentage of visitors who leave without engaging.

Choosing the right success metrics will allow you to make informed decisions about the outcome of your test.
