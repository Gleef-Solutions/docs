Your first experiment just became significant? Congrats! üëè
<br/>Here are some ideas of what to do next.

### Implement the winning variation
Start by using the experiment learnings to maximize your conversion on the live product. Unfortunately, Gleef doesn't modify your definitive wording yet. Use your regular localization software, your CMS or contact your development team.

### Stop the experiment
Goodbye, experiment. While you can delete it from the experiment detail screen, we recommend you only suspend it to keep the results in your dashboard. For clarity, we'll always show active experiments first in your dashboard.
<Info>
    As a reminder, experiments on the same page are mutually exclusive. Good news: by suspending an already significant experiment, you're routing more trafic to a non-significant experiments on the same page.
</Info>

### Create the next experiment
Keep experimenting to find other conversion improvements. As a reminder, all text elements can be tested with Gleef, regardless of the technology. Not inspired? We worked with experimentation experts to put together an extensive framework, as well as an AI tool providing suggestions. Email us at [contact@gleef.eu](mailto:contact@gleef.eu) to learn more!

<Tip>
    Keep testing new hypotheses and iterate based on your findings. <br/>
