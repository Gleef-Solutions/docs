<Tip>Having trouble finding the extension? Use [this direct link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gleef-alpha/dhaimaljdicccaplppipfiikonpdgeelify/) to download it.</Tip>

### Who can access the Gleef Chrome extension?
Anyone can install the extension, but only users with valid credentials and authorized accounts can create and manage experiments. Here’s what you need to know:
- **Open Access:** The extension can be downloaded and installed by anyone.
- **Editing Rights Required:** Only accounts with editing permissions for a specific website can run experiments. You won’t be able to modify or run tests on websites where you lack authorization.

This ensures only authorized personnel can make changes to your website.

### Are there specific requirements for installing Gleef?
Yes, to ensure smooth operation, make sure you meet the following requirements:
1. **Google Chrome:** You must use the latest version of Google Chrome.
2. **JavaScript Implementation:** You need access to your website’s code to add custom JavaScript, which is required for running experiments.

### How do I create a Gleef account?
Creating a **demo account** is simple and allows you to save drafts of experiments, though results won’t be live. Here’s how:
- Visit the signup page via the Chrome extension and follow the registration process.
- You can experiment in draft mode until you upgrade to a full account.

For a **real account**, contact us at [support@gleef.eu](mailto:support@gleef.eu), and we’ll help set it up so you can launch live experiments.

## Adding the Gleef JavaScript Snippet to My Website

### Why do I need to install the JavaScript snippet?
The JavaScript snippet enables event tracking, visitor segmentation, and running A/B tests on your website. Without this snippet, Gleef won’t be able to record or process experiments.

### How do I add the Gleef JavaScript snippet to my website?
Follow these steps:
1. **Copy the Snippet:** Once you sign up, Gleef will provide you with a unique JavaScript snippet.
2. **Paste Before `</body>` Tag:** Insert the snippet into the HTML of your website before the closing `</body>` tag on all pages where you want to run experiments.
   
<Info>Installing the Gleef JavaScript snippet is a one-time task. Ensure that this tag is present on all pages where you want to track events and run tests.</Info>

### What happens if the snippet is missing on a page?
If the snippet is missing from a page, Gleef will not be able to track user interactions or run tests on that page. Make sure it is present on every page where you want to track data.

## Best Practices for Setting Up Gleef

### How can I ensure smooth installation and usage?
1. **Double-check JavaScript Placement:** Ensure the Gleef JavaScript snippet is placed correctly on all relevant pages.
2. **Test the Setup:** After installing the extension and adding the JavaScript, run a quick test to ensure the experiments are working as expected.
3. **Keep Permissions in Mind:** Make sure that only authorized personnel have access to the Chrome extension on your website.

### Can I use a tag manager to install the Gleef snippet?
It’s possible to use a tag manager, but we recommend directly placing the snippet in your website’s code. Tag managers may delay the loading of the script, which could affect the performance of your experiments.
