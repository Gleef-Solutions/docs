Setting up your first experiment is quick and easy, taking less than 5 minutes.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open Gleef's Extension on the Relevant Page">
        Ensure you open Gleef's extension on the page where you want to run the experiment.

        <Warning>Your account may be tied to the current URL domain for creating experiments. If you wish to experiment on a different domain, please [contact us](mailto:support@gleef.eu).</Warning>

        If you're on the wrong page, navigate to the desired one before opening the extension.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Login with Your Credentials">
        If you're not already logged in, you will be prompted to enter your credentials.

        <Info>If you don't have credentials, you can create a demo account ([learn how](/how-to/signup)) or [contact us](mailto:support@gleef.eu) to validate a paid account.</Info>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a New Experiment">
        Click the 'New Experiment' button to begin.

        <Warning>This will create an experiment on the current page. If you want to set up an experiment on another page, navigate there before opening Gleef.</Warning>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select the Wording to Experiment">
        <Frame>
            <img width="300" src="/images/Experiment-creation_Step1_mockup-colors.png" alt="step 1"/>
        </Frame>
        
        Select the text on your website that you wish to test. If you're unable to select the wording, it may be because it's part of an image or not within standard HTML text tags.

        Refer to our [FAQ](TK) for more information.
    
        <Note>
            When you choose a specific element, all identical elements on the page will be included in the experiment to maintain consistency. This means all matching components will be affected.
        </Note>

        <Info>You can select multiple elements on the page. [Learn how](TK).</Info>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define the Variations">
        <Frame>
            <img width="300" src="/images/Experiment-creation_Step2_mockup-colors.png" alt="step 2"/>
        </Frame>
        Create the variations you want to test. While there's no limit on the number of variations in Gleef, we recommend no more than 2 variations (plus the baseline) for optimal results ([learn why](TK)).

        Refer to our [best practices](/Q&A/best-practices) for guidance on setting up effective experiments.

        <Tip>More variations will extend the time needed to achieve statistically significant results. [Learn more](TK).</Tip>

        The 'baseline' represents the original text and cannot be removed, as it serves as the control in your A/B test.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Define the Success Event for the Experiment">
        <Frame>
            <img width="300" src="/images/Experiment-creation_Step3_mockup-colors.png" alt="step 3"/>
        </Frame>

        Gleef allows you to define two types of success events in line with [A/B testing best practices](TK):
        1. **Click on the Call-to-Action (CTA):**  
        For tests involving a CTA button, you can set the success event as a click. This only works for clickable CTA text, and the first click will be tracked as the success event tied to the variation shown.
        
        <Warning>Currently, there's no direct option to select a CTA separate from the tested text, but there is a workaround. [Learn how](TK).</Warning>
        
        2. **Specific URL Visit:**  
        Define a success event as reaching a specific URL (e.g., a 'thank you' or 'purchase confirmation' page). This is useful for testing headlines or other non-CTA elements.

        See our [success events guide](/how-to/success-event) for more information.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Name Your Experiment">
        <Frame>
            <img width="300" src="/images/Experiment-creation_Step4_mockup-colors.png" alt="step 4"/>
        </Frame>
        Name your experiment to easily locate it in your Gleef dashboard. We recommend following your company's naming conventions.

        A suggested naming format is "**Element in test** – **Page of the test**." Example:
        - **CTA 1 Landing:** For a CTA experiment on the landing page, such as the primary 'Shop Now' button.
        - **Headline About:** For a headline test on the About page, with the success event set to a 'Contact Us' page.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Save or Launch Your Experiment">
        Congratulations! You're ready to either save your experiment as a draft or launch it immediately, depending on your needs.
