Creating effective variations is a crucial part of a successful A/B test. The changes you introduce must be impactful enough to show measurable differences in performance.

## Baseline vs. Variations

### Keep the Default Text as Baseline
The baseline (original version) serves as the reference point. Ensure that the baseline reflects your current best-performing version, so you can measure improvements against it.

### How Many Variations Should You Test?
To keep your experiment manageable and ensure statistical significance, limit the number of variations to two or three. Each additional variation requires more traffic and time to achieve reliable results.

<Info>
    You’ll need around 7,000 users per variation to detect a 1% change in performance from your baseline. <br/>

## What Elements Should You Experiment With?

- **Headlines:** Experiment with different headlines to see which captures more user attention.
- **Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons:** Changing CTA wording (e.g., “Buy Now” vs. “Get Started”) can dramatically impact user behavior.
- **Product Descriptions:** Clearer, more concise descriptions often lead to higher conversion rates.

By focusing on high-impact elements, you ensure that your test drives meaningful improvements in user experience and conversion rates.

### Why No UI Experiments?
Gleef specializes in A/B testing for wording, not UI. Testing user interface (UI) elements involves different strategies that can affect the overall structure of your website. Our goal is to keep A/B testing simple, no-code, and focused on wording.
