Generating localization keys is a breeze with Gleef. Here is how it works:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open Gleef's Figma Plugin">
        Open the Gleef plugin in Figma. You can find it in the Plugins menu.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select the Frame you want to generate keys for">
        <Frame>
            <img width="300" src="/images/figma-plugin_select-frame.png" alt="Select the frame you want to generate keys for"/>
       </Frame>

        Select the frame you want to generate keys for.
        
        <Warning>It is highly recommended to select a frame containing your **whole screen** to maximize the context, enabling efficient key generation. </Warning>

        
        If you select a frame containing only a part of the screen, Gleef will generate keys for that part only. This can lead to missing keys or keys that are not relevant to the whole screen.
        
        If you select a frame containing multiple screens, Gleef will generate keys for all of them. This can lead to duplicate keys or keys that are not relevant to the whole screen.

        Here is an example at what should be selected: Checkout_AddAddress frame
        <Frame>
            <img width="300" src="/images/figma-plugin_selected-frame.png" alt="Select the whole frame"/>
        </Frame>

        Check out [our documentation](/figma-plugin/support/QA#generating-keys) to understand how does frame selection and generation works.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Manage keys">
        Once keys are generated, you can manage them in the Gleef plugin. You can edit and ignore keys as well as display them dynamically in your Figma, and export them.
