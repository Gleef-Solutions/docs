<Tip>In order to have the best experience using the Figma Plugin, use the Gleef Studio and Gleef CLI to easily manage your translations and avoid file export/import.</Tip>

## Why importing existing keys?
Importing existing keys in the Plugin has 2 main benefits:
- Existing translations will help improve the Gleef AI performance for your project
- Keys generated by the Plugin thereafter will be consistent with your current pattern: e.g. delimiters used, nomenclature etc.
- Keys can be re-used if they already exist in your localization files.

## How to import existing keys?
It depends on your current localization stack:

### With a localization software
If you are using a localization software, you can export your localization keys to a CSV or JSON file and import it in the Plugin.
The process depends on which localization software you use.

You can [contact us](mailto:support@gleef.eu) if you need help exporting your keys.

### Without a localization software
If you are not using a localization software, you can directly import the file you use to manage your localization keys and variables.
You can import XML, CSV, or JSON files.

## When importing existing keys?

### Onboarding

</Frame>

During the onboarding, you can import existing keys to improve the performance of the Gleef AI.

### After onboarding

Thereafter, at any time, you can easily import your localization keys in the Plugin.

<Tip>Regularly importing your localization files will enable updating your keys in the Plugin, so that it stays up to date, generates accurate keys, and reuses existing ones.</Tip>

You won't see how many files you've already imported, because Gleef doesn't store your files, but vectorise all the keys, generating embeddings in a database specific to your company.
You'll just see the last update date so that you might know if the Plugin database is up to date or not.

<Tip>You wanna know more on how we store your data, and how to update your keys? Have a look at our [specific documentation](/figma-plugin/support/embeddings).</Tip>
