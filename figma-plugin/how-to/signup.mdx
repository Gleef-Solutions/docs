  <Step title="Import your Localization Keys File">
    Once logged into the extension, you'll be prompted to upload your current localization keys file.
    
    We highly recommend that you provide a file, for many reasons:
    - It ensures that the keys you generate are unique and don't conflict with existing ones.
    - It allows to reuse existing keys without generating new ones when possible.
    - It makes sure the pattern of generated keys is consistent with your existing one.

    <Warning>Not importing keys won't prevent you from generating new ones, but it will make them less useful.</Warning>
