## Overview
This section guides you through installing and setting up the Gleef Figma Plugin in your project.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the plugin">
        Install the plugin directly from the Figma community marketplace into your project.
        <Info>
            Access the plugin [here](http://figma.gleef.eu).
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign up">
        Create a Gleef account directly within the plugin interface.

        <Info>You need to be part of the same Gleef team to share translations. If you don't have access to the Gleef Studio to manage your team, please [contact us](contact@gleef.eu).</Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select your source and target languages">
        Specify the language you're currently using in Figma so that Gleef can accurately match your existing keys with your designs. Then, select the languages you want to include for AI translation.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate keys and translations">
        Select one or several frame(s) in your Figma project with the plugin open, then click "Generate". The process typically takes between 10-60 seconds.
        <Info>
            For more details on generation, refer to our [documentation](/docs).
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Manage translations">
        With your frame selected, you can now view all keys and translations that were retrieved or generated. You can easily:
        - Preview translations
        - Click on elements to focus them in the frame
        - Edit keys and translations
        - Exclude specific items from export
        - Export keys and translations in multiple formats
        <Tip>Tired of dealing with file exports and painful localization processes? Use the [Gleef Studio]() and [Gleef CLI]() to collaborate with your team.</Tip>
