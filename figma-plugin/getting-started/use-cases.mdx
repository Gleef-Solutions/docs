## Use case #1: Using Gleef to Increase Conversion Rates
<Note>+97% CTR by changing a single CTA on the landing page</Note>

<Accordion title="Discover the case">
    ### Scenario
    A loan company used Gleef to A/B test different call-to-action (CTA) buttons on their website with the goal of increasing the conversion rate for loan applications. They tested three variations to determine which wording was most effective in encouraging users to start the loan application process.


    ### Initial Wording
    The original CTA button text was “Apply for a loan”.

    ### Hypothesis
    The company hypothesized that changing the wording on the CTA button would influence user behavior and conversion rates.

    ### A/B Test Setup
    1. **Variant A (Baseline Text):**
    - "Apply for a loan"

    2. **Variant B (New Text):**
    - "Get started"

    3. **Variant C (New Text):**
    - "Simulate your loan"

    ### Experiment
    Using Gleef, the loan company set up an A/B test with the three CTA button variants. They measured the conversion rate, which was the percentage of visitors who initiated the loan application process.

    ### Results
    - **Variant A (Apply for a loan):** Conversion rate is used as the baseline.
    - **Variant B (Get started):** Conversion rate increased by 7%.
    - **Variant C (Simulate your loan):** Conversion rate decreased by 6%.

    ### Conclusion
    Against the initial hypothesis, the simple and direct wording "Get started" performed significantly better, resulting in a 7% increase in the conversion rate. Conversely, "Simulate your loan" led to a 6% decrease in the conversion rate. The company was surprised by the substantial positive impact of the shorter, more action-oriented text.

    ### Action
    Based on these results, the loan company decided to replace the original CTA button text with "Get started" across their website. Additionally, they planned to use Gleef for further A/B testing on other elements to continue optimizing their conversion rates.

## Use case #2: Using Gleef to Reduce After-Sales Questions
<Note>Reducing by more than 50% after-sales requests</Note>

<Accordion title="Discover the case">
    ### Scenario
    An e-commerce client specializing in outdoor equipment saved valuable support resources using Gleef to A/B test content on their FAQ page. Their primary objective was to clear up customer confusion and cut down the volume of after-sales support queries by enhancing the clarity and comprehensiveness of product care instructions.

    ### Initial Wording
    The original FAQ page contained a sparse "Product Care Instructions" section, which included the text: "To ensure the longevity of your product, follow the care instructions provided." 

    ### Hypothesis
    The client deduced that enriching the FAQ with in-depth, specific product care guidelines would empower customers and preemptively address potential support queries related to product maintenance.

    ### A/B Test Setup
    1. **Variant A (Original Text):**
    - "To ensure the longevity of your product, follow the care instructions provided."

    2. **Variant B (New Text):**
    - "For optimal equipment performance, clean with mild soap and water after each use and store in a dry place. Visit our Care Guide for detailed tips."

    ### Experiment
    Using Gleef, the client conducted an A/B test to assess the effectiveness of these two variants. Performance was measured by monitoring the number of clicks on the "Contact Support" button and tracking the volume of support tickets specifically related to product care.

    ### Results
    - **Variant A:** Generated over 150 support tickets related to product care each week.
    - **Variant B:** Reduced support tickets related to product care to approximately 100 each week.

    ### Conclusion
    The revised wording (Variant B) led to a substantial 33% reduction in support tickets. The detailed instructions provided significantly more value to customers, straightening out ambiguity and diminishing the need they served as Reword to reach out to customer support. This profound impact wasn't anticipated from what initially seemed like a minor modification in diction.

    ### Action
    Encouraged by the surprising and positive results, the client decided to implement the new, more informative wording across their entire FAQ section. They also plan to conduct further A/B tests on other FAQ topics to continually enhance the clarity and effectiveness of their customer support content. By doing so, they aim to reduce customer confusion even further and improve overall support efficiency. With Gleef, they’re seeing just how powerful detailed, clear communication can be for their business satisfaction.
