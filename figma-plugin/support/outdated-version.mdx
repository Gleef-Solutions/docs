## Why do I need to update?

We're continuously improving Gleef to deliver better localization experiences and enhanced AI-powered translation quality. While we maintain backward compatibility when possible, some updates include significant improvements that require the latest version to function properly.

When you see this message, it means we've made substantial enhancements to:
- Translation accuracy and context understanding
- Plugin performance and reliability
- New features that streamline your localization workflow

## How to update your plugin

Figma typically updates plugins automatically, but manual updates are sometimes needed. Here's how to ensure you have the latest version:

1. **Close Gleef in all files** — Make sure the plugin isn't running in any Figma files
2. **Restart Figma completely**
- **Desktop app**: Quit Figma entirely and relaunch
- **Web browser**: Close all Figma tabs and open a new session
3. **Reopen Gleef** in any file — The plugin should now be updated to the latest version

**Still seeing the update message?** This usually resolves the issue, but if you continue to see the warning after following these steps, please [contact our support team](mailto:contact@gleef.eu) and we'll help you get back on track.
