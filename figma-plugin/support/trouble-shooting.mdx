## Common import issues
### File parsing errors
Verify your file respects common CSV, XML or JSON formatting.
Here are the format we use:
   - **CSV**:
      ```CSV
         key, value
      ```
   - **JSON**: given a key named: parent.subparent.element with the value: value
      ```JSON
      {
      "parent": {
         "subparent": {
            "element": "value"
         }
      }
      ```
   - **XML**:
      ```xml
      <resources>
      <string name="key1">value1</string>
      <string name="key2">value2</string>
      </resources>
      ```
   <Warning>Values are expected to be the same language as the one used to design your files</Warning>

### File too large
Split the file into smaller chunks

### File encoding issues
Ensure the file is encoded in UTF-8, so that special characters are properly interpreted

### File format not supported
Gleef supports CSV, JSON, and XML files. If you need another file formatting, please try converting your file in another format, or [contact us](contact@gleef.eu).

## Plugin issues
### Plugin not loading
It can sometimes happen, mainly due to Figma. Try running it online (on your browser) or switching to Figma's app. Sometimes deleting the plugin and re-downloading it might also solve this issue.

### Slow performance
As you may have already experience using AI, it sometimes takes longer than usual to generate answers.

### Authentication errors
If you encounter any authentication errors, try logging out and logging back in. If the issue persists, please [contact us](contact@gleef.eu).

## Error while generating keys
### During generation
Try not to select another frame than the one you want to generate keys for. If the issue persists, please [contact us](contact@gleef.eu).

### Key duplication
It can sometimes happen that a key is duplicated in your screen while generating. It means that the element is the same and so only one key should be used.
You can edit the key name, but won't be able to get back to the duplicated status manually, as Gleef doesn't enable manual key duplication.
No worries, export files will only have one key.

### Existing Keys
- **Missing keys:** If some keys should be marked down as `existing` but are not, it might mean that they are not in the current knowledge base.
Try importing these keys and regenerate this frame, [see more on key import](/figma-plugin/how-to/import-keys).
- **Key value conflict:** A key can be tagged as existing, with a different value than the one in the knowledge base. If it is the case, the export file will have the value from the current Frame.

### Solutions
1. Check internet connection
2. Clear Figma plugin cache
3. Reload Figma
4. Check Gleef status page
